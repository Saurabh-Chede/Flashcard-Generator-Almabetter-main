# `FLASHCARD GENERATOR

## `Project Description`
The Flashcard Generator project is a front-end capstone assignment given by Almabetter. It involves creating an application for generating flashcards within a group. This application provides functionalities such as creating cards, adding text and images, sharing, downloading, deleting, and printing the generated flashcards. The user interface of the application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a smooth experience across different devices.

This Project Consists of 3 main pages:

1. ### `Create New Page`
   Here, a new card group is generated by completing all the necessary information and selecting the "create" option.

2. ### `MyFlashCard Page`

   cards within the group, and a button for navigating to the cards on the next page.
